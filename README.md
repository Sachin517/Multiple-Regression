# Multiple-Regression
Regression Model
Predicting the coefficeint of the cars which are affecting the price of the cars
-  Checked for the NULL Values or Outliers
- Transformed the Categorical data into Numerical data by using DUmmies 
-  Done with RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) to get the best variables
-  Checked with VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) to check with Multicolinearity To see wether the variable is highly correlated with same variabe
- Done with Manual Elimination of the variable and checked with R2 value so that we can get the best out of the Train data and predicted the same on Test Data 
- predicted and Evaluated on Both train and test data and got the best coefficients
